<p>The easiest way to get sound from SC is to use a Function. Below is a simple example of this. Execute this (after making sure the server is booted), and when you're sick of it, press Cmd - . (that's hold down the command key and press the period or fullstop key) to stop the sound. This will always stop all sound in SC. You'll be using it a lot, so commit it to memory.<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>{ [SinOsc.ar(440, 0, 0.2), SinOsc.ar(442, 0, 0.2)] }.play;</pre>

<p>Not too inspiring? Don't worry, we're just getting started, and this is just a simple example to demonstrate Functions and sound. We'll take it apart a bit below.
<p>Before we get to doing that though, let's learn a little about Functions in general.
<p>A Function is just a reusable bit of code. You define a Function by enclosing code in 'curly brackets': { }. Here's an example:<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f = { "Function evaluated".postln; };</pre>

<p>The stuff within the curly brackets is what will get executed each time you reuse, or evaluate the Function. Note that this is written like an equation, i.e. <code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f = {...}</code>. This is not an equation in the mathematical sense, it's what's called an assignment. Basically it allows me to name the Function I've created, by storing it in a variable called <code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f</code>. A variable is just a name representing a slot in which we can store things, such as a Function, a number, a list, etc. Execute the following lines one at a time and watch the post window:<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f = { "Function evaluated".postln; };
f;</pre>

<p>Both times it should say <code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>'a Function'</code>. Now whenever we want to refer to our Function we can just use the letter f. That's in fact what makes it reusable! Otherwise we'd need to type the Function in every time.
<p>So how do we reuse it? Execute the following lines one at a time and watch the post window:<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f = { "Function evaluated".postln; };
f.value;
f.value;
f.value;</pre>

<p>Our Function is an object, (i.e a thing that does something or represents something), which we have defined and stored in the variable <code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f</code>. The bit of code that says <code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>'.value'</code> says evaluate this function now. This is an example of sending a message to an object. This follows the syntax someObject.someMessage. The dot must go in between.
<p>Now this next bit is a little bit tricky. In a given object, each <em>message</em> calls (calls means executes) a particular <em>method</em>. Different types of objects may have methods with the same name, and thus respond to the same message in different ways. Whoah, get that? Read it again slowly, as this is pretty important:
<p><em>Different types of objects may have methods with the same name, and thus respond to the same message in different ways.</em>
<p>What's interesting about this is that the actual methods may differ in what they do, but as long as they implement a method with that name, they become interchangeable in your code.
<p>A good example is 'value'. All objects in SC respond to the message 'value'. When you 'call' a method, it always 'returns' something, such as a value or a result. When you call the method 'value' on a Function it will evaluate and return the result of its last line of code. The example below will return the number 5.<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f = { "Evaluating...".postln; 2 + 3; };
f.value;</pre>

<p>Often methods simply return the object itself. This is the case with most objects and the message 'value'. The example below demonstrates this. (Everything to the right of the <code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>//</code> is a 'comment', which means that SC just ignores it. Comments are a good idea to make your code clearer.)<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f = 3;            // Here I make f equal to a number
f.value;        // Post window says: 3, i.e it returns itself
f.value;        // Still says 3

f = { 3.0.rand; };    // Here it's a Function.
f.value;        // 3.0.rand means return a random value from 0 to 3.0 exclusive.
f.value;        // something different
f.value;        // something different</pre>

<p>This means that by using the 'value' method Functions and other objects can be interchangeable in your code. This is an example of <em>polymorphism</em>, which is one of the powerful features of what's called Object Oriented Programming. Polymorphism just means that different objects are interchangeable (at least providing they return something sensible for what you're doing) if they respond to the same message. Object Oriented Programming (or OOP, as it's called for short) just means programming with objects. Simple, yes? Here's another short example showing this in action:<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f = { arg a; a.value + 3 };    // call 'value' on the arg; polymorphism awaits!
f.value(3);            // 3.value = 3, so this returns 3 + 3 = 6
g = { 3.0.rand; };
f.value(g);            // here the arg is a Function. Cool, huh?
f.value(g);            // try it again, different result</pre>

<p>Start to see how this could be useful?
<p>Functions can also have what are called arguments. These are values which are passed into the Function when it is evaluated. The example below demonstrates how this works. See if you can guess what the result will be before executing it.<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>(
f = { arg a, b;
    a - b;
};
f.value(5, 3);
)</pre>

<p>Arguments are declared at the beginning of the Function, using the keyword <code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>'arg'</code>. You can then refer to them just like variables. When you call value on a Function, you can pass in arguments, in order, by putting them in parentheses: <code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>someFunc.value(arg1, arg2)</code>. This is the same with any method that takes arguments, not just value.
<p>You can specify different orders by using what are called keyword arguments:<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f = { arg a, b; a / b; };    // '/' means divide
f.value(10, 2);            // regular style
f.value(b: 2, a: 10);        // keyword style</pre>

<p>You can mix regular and keyword style if you like, but the regular args must come first:<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f = { arg a, b, c, d; (a + b) * c - d };
f.value(2, c:3, b:4, d: 1); // 2 + 4 * 3 - 1</pre>

<p>(Note that SC has no operator precedence, i.e. math operations are done in order, and division and multiplication are not done first. To force an order use parentheses. e.g. 4 + (2* 8) )
<p>Sometimes it's useful to set default values for arguments. You can do this like so:<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f = { arg a, b = 2; a + b; };
f.value(2);             // 2 + 2</pre>

<p>Default values must be what are called literals. Literals are basically numbers, strings, symbols (more on these later), or collections of them. Don't worry if that doesn't totally make sense, it will become clearer as we go on.
<p>There is an alternate way to specify args, which is to enclose them within two vertical lines. (On most keyboards the vertical line symbol is Shift-\ ) The following two Functions are equivalent:<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f = { arg a, b; a + b; };
g = { |a, b| a + b; };
f.value(2, 2);
g.value(2, 2);</pre>

<p>Why have two different ways? Well some people like the second one better and consider it a shortcut. SC has a number of syntax shortcuts like this, which can make writing code a little faster. In any case you will encounter both forms, so you need to be aware of them.
<p>You can also have variables in a Function. These you need to declare at the beginning of the Function, just after the args, using the keyword <code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>'var'</code>.<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>(
f = { arg a, b;
    var firstResult, finalResult;
    firstResult = a + b;
    finalResult = firstResult * 2;
    finalResult;
};
f.value(2, 3);    // this will return (2 + 3) * 2 = 10
)</pre>

<p>Variable and argument names can consist of letters and numbers, but must begin with a lower-case letter and cannot contain spaces.
<p>Variables are only valid for what is called their scope. The scope of a variable declared in a Function is that Function, i.e. the area between the two curly brackets. Execute these one at a time:<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f = { var foo; foo = 3; foo; };
f.value;
foo;            // this will cause an error as 'foo' is only valid within f.</pre>

<p>You can also declare variables at the top of any block of code which you execute altogether (i.e. by selecting it all). In such a case that block of code is the variable's scope. Execute the block (in parentheses) and then the last line.<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>(
var myFunc;
myFunc = { |input| input.postln; };
myFunc.value("foo");    // arg is a String
myFunc.value("bar");
)

myFunc;            // throws an error</pre>

<p>You may be wondering why we haven't needed to declare variables like <code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>f</code>, and why they don't seem to have any particular scope (i.e. they keep there values even when executing code one line at a time). The letters a to z are what are called interpreter variables. These are pre-declared when you start up SC, and have an unlimited, or 'global', scope. This makes them useful for quick tests or examples. You've already encountered one of these, the variable 's', which you'll recall by default refers to the localhost server.
