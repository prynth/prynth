<p>There are a couple of different ways to have several patterns playing at the same time. The most obvious is to play them separately. The patterns' events get scheduled independently on their clock(s) and run concurrently. None of these patterns need to have any knowledge of the others. One advantage of this approach is that the patterns can be stopped and started independently.
<p>The other is to combine them into a parallel stream. The result is a single pattern object that can be played or stopped only as one unit. Some degree of interactive control is lost, but there are times when merging several patterns is necessary -- for instance, converting a pattern into a Score object for NRT rendering.<dl>
<dt><code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>Ppar(list, repeats)</code><dd>Start each of the event patterns in the <code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>list</code> at the same time. When the last one finishes, the <a href="./../../Classes/Ppar.html">Ppar</a> also stops. If <code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>repeats &gt; 1</code>, all the subpatterns start over again from the beginning.<dt><code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>Ptpar(list, repeats)</code><dd>Here, the list consists of <code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>[timeOffset0, pattern0, timeOffset1, pattern1...]</code> . Each pattern starts after the number of beats given as its time offset. The patterns can start at different times relative to each other.<dt><code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>Pgpar(list, repeats)</code><dd>Like Ppar, but it creates a separate group for each subpattern.<dt><code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>Pgtpar(list, repeats)</code><dd>This is like Ptpar with separate groups for the subpatterns.</dl>

<p>An excellent example of <a href="./../../Classes/Ppar.html">Ppar</a> and <a href="./../../Classes/Pseq.html">Pseq</a> used together to structure an entire piece (Kraftwerk's "Spacelab") can be found in examples/pieces/spacelab.scd.<h3><a class='anchor' name='Dynamic parallelizing'>Dynamic parallelizing</a></h3>

<p>Ppar and its cousins are good for a fixed set of parallel patterns -- that is, you need to know in advance how many patterns will be parallelized. Once the parallel pattern starts, there is no way to add more streams to it. To keep adding streams, use <a href="./../../Classes/Pspawner.html">Pspawner</a> and <a href="./../../Classes/Pspawn.html">Pspawn</a>. For the purpose of this overview, some basic features will be illustrated in a couple of simple examples. These classes have more capabilities; refer to their help files for specifics.<dl>
<dt><code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>Pspawner(routineFunc)</code><dd>The function is run in a Routine. A Spawner object gets passed into this Routine, and this object is used to add or remove streams to/from the parallel stream. New patterns can be added in sequence or in parallel.<dt><code class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>Pspawn(pattern, spawnProtoEvent)</code><dd>Supports most of the features of Pspawner, but uses a pattern to control the Spawner object instead of a Routine function.
<p>This example uses <a href="./../../Classes/Pspawner.html">Pspawner</a> to trigger overlapping scale segments at different speeds. Unlike Ppar, which could handle a fixed number before stopping, Pspawner can keep going indefinitely.<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>(
p = Pspawner({ |sp|    // sp = the Spawner object
    loop {
            // run a new pattern in parallel
            // the pattern is finite
            // after a few events, it stops and the Pspawner forgets about it
        sp.par(Pbind(
            \degree, Pseries(rrand(-5, 7), #[-1, 1].choose, rrand(4, 7)),
            \pan, rrand(-1.0, 1.0),
            \dur, rrand(0.1, 0.3)    // duration is chosen once for each pattern
        ));
            // tell the Spawner to wait a bit before the next pattern goes
            // DO NOT use numBeats.wait for this!
            // Everything must go through the Spawner
        sp.wait(rrand(1, 4) * 0.25);
    }
}).play;
)

p.stop;</pre>

<p>The same, written using <a href="./../../Classes/Pspawn.html">Pspawn</a> :<pre class='code prettyprint lang-sc'>(
p = Pspawn(Pbind(
    \method, \par,        // embed patterns in parallel
        // generate the subpattern in a Pfunc (so there's a new pattern each time)
        // Pfunc returns the pattern without rendering the stream
        // -- important for Pspawn
        // See the Pspawn helpfile for other ways to embed patterns
    \pattern, Pfunc {
        Pbind(
            \degree, Pseries(rrand(-5, 7), #[-1, 1].choose, rrand(4, 7)),
            \pan, rrand(-1.0, 1.0),
            \dur, rrand(0.1, 0.3)    // duration is chosen once for each pattern
        )
    },
        // The \delta key is used automatically for the spawner.wait() call
    \delta, Pwhite(1, 4, inf) * 0.25
